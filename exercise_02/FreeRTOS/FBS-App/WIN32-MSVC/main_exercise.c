/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE: Windows will not be running the FreeRTOS demo threads continuously, so
 * do not expect to get real time behaviour from the FreeRTOS Windows port, or
 * this demo application.  Also, the timing information in the FreeRTOS+Trace
 * logs have no meaningful units.  See the documentation page for the Windows
 * port for further information:
 * http://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Windows-Simulator-Emulator-for-Visual-Studio-and-Eclipse-MingW.html
 * 
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * NOTE:  Console input and output relies on Windows system calls, which can
 * interfere with the execution of the FreeRTOS Windows port.  This demo only
 * uses Windows system call occasionally.  Heavier use of Windows system calls
 * can crash the port.
